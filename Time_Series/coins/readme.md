# Cryptocurrency price data from Kaggle

The data was download at [https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory?select=coin_Bitcoin.csv][1]
containing the price of Bitcoin since 2013-04-29 and many other coins.

To learn how to process the data please take a look at this [notebook][3] or its [original post][2].

**Remarks.**
1. To run a github notebook replace `github` by `githubtocolab` in the corresponding link.
2. To download the notebook from that webpage, I did log in to Deepnote (suggested at the top of the page) with my gmail (longtran) and then open and download it.
